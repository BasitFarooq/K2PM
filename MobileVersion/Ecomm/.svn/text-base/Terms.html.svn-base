                        party).

                    <p>
                        Advertisers who purchase ad impressions from NAC on any of our online newspaper
                        sites must have either the company's registered URL or name in one of the frames
                        of the ad. Under no circumstances do we accept advertising without identifying the
                        company. The advertiser agrees that it is responsible to third parties for the content
                        of advertisements placed. In the event that NAC, The Salt Lake Tribune or Deseret
                        Morning News becomes liable to any third party as a result of an advertisement,
                        the advertiser agrees to indemnify any or all of them for damages owed to the third
                        party and for the fees and costs associated with the controversy.

                        The publishers reserve the right to edit, reject or cancel any advertisement at
                        any time, before or after placement. K2PS online publication does not accept online
                        advertising for massage, escort services, astrology, (900) numbers, gambling, NC-17
                        or X-rated movies, or any site deemed to contain pornographic material. Neither
                        will K2PS knowingly accept advertising for a book, motion picture or product involved
                        in pending litigation.

                        Publishers reserve the right to review all potential advertisers' Web sites at any
                        time, before or after placement, to determine whether they are deemed "site aggregators."
                        Generally, a site aggregator is viewed as a site that acts as a portal/destination
                        site containing content and advertising from multiple entities. Publishers reserve
                        the right to reject advertising that is deemed competitive or contrary to the best
                        interests of the company.

                    <p>
                        Advertising agencies who wish to purchase space within our online sites must meet
                        the following criteria:

                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Space must be purchased by a single specific advertising representative.
                        </li>
                        <li>2. All Advertising Agencies must execute a Media Agency Agreement with K2PS, which
                            must be signed and acknowledged by all parties before any advertisement placement
                            can occur. </li>
                        <li>3. Contracts for space must be signed by the advertiser, and a signed agency agreement
                            must accompany the contract. </li>
                    </ul>

                        32) K2PS reserves the right to reject any advertisement at any time after receipt
                        of proof of text, copy and/or illustrations, even though a prior similar order may
                        have been approved. K2PS shall have the right to omit any advertisement when the
                        space allotted to advertising has been filled. Unintentional or inadvertent failure
                        to publish advertising invalidates the insertion order for that issue only. Failure
                        of K2PS to insert any advertisement shall be considered immaterial and shall not
                        constitute a breach of this Agreement, nor shall K2PS be liable for damages thereof.
                        In such event, Advertiser shall have the option of having such advertisement printed
                        in a future issue under these Terms and Conditions or of having no charge for such
                        advertisement not inserted. Advertisements already run shall be paid for at rates
                        as noted in our Placement Option of this agreement. K2PS reserves the right to require
                        any advertising to be labeled "advertisement."

                        personal rights. Advertiser agrees at Advertiser’s own expense, to promptly defend
                        and continue the defense of any such claim, demand, action or proceeding that may
                        be brought against K2PS, provided that K2PS shall promptly notify Advertiser with
                        respect thereto. The Advertiser shall reimburse K2PS for any amount paid by K2PS
