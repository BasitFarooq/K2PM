                        GLOSSARY</h2>
                    <strong>Cause:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Something in the private or public interest which can be clearly identified and
                        defined as being important to a large number of people in a community or in society.
                        Causes are often charitable causes and are typically understood to relate to health
                        care or disease control, children’s or other social development issues, environmental
                        or animal protection or other issues thought to be in the best interests of the
                        community.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Cause marketing (or cause-related marketing):</strong>
                    <p>
                        A specific kind or practice of marketing in which for-profit private businesses
                        cooperate with non-profit organizations or charitable causes for mutual benefit.
                        It is sometimes used to refer generally to the marketing of social or other charitable
                        causes. Unlike direct corporate philanthropy or corporate giving, it does not necessarily
                        involve tax-deductible donations (cause marketing is not contingent on the donation
                        of cash). Most students and historians of cause-related marketing attribute its
                        origins in the 1983 American Express campaign designed to raise funds and awareness
                        for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty in New York City.

                        Charity or Charitable organization:</h2>
                    <p>
                        An organization created for charitable purposes only. All charitable organizations
                        are not-for-profit organizations (although not all not-for-profit organizations
                        are charitable organizations). Charitable organizations can take the form of trusts,
                        foundations, unincorporated associations or specifically-defined companies. In all
                        cases, they are established for a charitable purpose or are clearly defined to acquire
                        that status and purpose after they are established.
                    </p>

                        Community Investment:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Any form of investment which generates resultant community benefits, amenities or
                        other legacies, ranging from direct donations to marketing to public spin-offs from
                        private ventures.

                    <h2>
                        Corporate Philanthropy:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The process or practice in which private corporations or for-profit businesses donate
                        money, goods, time and/or effort to support a charitable cause or other commonly-accepted
                        worthy community cause or interest. When corporate philanthropy involves the direct
                        donation of cash, it carries a corporate tax benefit (as opposed to other forms
                        of community investment or cause-related marketing which may or may not be undertaken
                        for its tax benefits).

                        gift, typically of money, goods or time, to a charitable organization or specific
                        cause (the donation is made “for charitable purposes”).

                        Raising money or other value-in-kind by requesting donations from individuals, businesses,
                        organizations, charitable foundations or government agencies. Fundraising typically
                        is understood to refer to those efforts done to gather funds for non-profit organizations
                        and charitable causes (although it is also referred to as the identification and
                        solicitation of investors for private capital placements and ventures).

                        Non-Profit Organization (or not-for-profit organization):</h2>

                        legally-constituted organization established to promote and develop an activity
                        or series of activities in the private or public interest without commercial or
                        monetary for-profit purposes. Most non-profits (also known as NPOs) operate in the
                        fields of sports, health care, education, arts, culture, environmental protection,
                        human rights and animal protection. NPOs also often exist in order to promote awareness
                        for and raise funds for political or religious causes.

                        Philanthropy:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The act of donating money, goods, time and/or effort to support a charitable cause
                        or other commonly-accepted worthy cause. Philanthropy is typically accepted to involve
                        a clearly-defined objective. It is also commonly understood to apply to giving over
                        an extended period of time. More broadly defined, philanthropy can refer to any
                        humanitarian or altruistic activity which promotes good or improves quality of life.
                        Philanthropy is derived from the Greek words phil and anthropos, which means “loving
                        people” or “human being”.

                        funds for a specific cause, usually with the support of a radio, television or other
                        broadcast medium to attract listeners, viewers and, ultimately, donors. Pledge drives
                        are often delivered in the form of telethons or radio campaigns, including in some
                        cases to raise funds for that public broadcaster.
