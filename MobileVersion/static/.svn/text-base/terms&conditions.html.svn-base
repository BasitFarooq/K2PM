              <li> If you use the Embeddable Player on your website, you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion or functionality of the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the K2PS website. </li>

              <li> You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the K2PS servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.
