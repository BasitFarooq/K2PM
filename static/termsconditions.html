            F. GENERAL USE OF THE SERVICE – PERMISSION AND RESTRICTIONS</h6>
        <p>
            K2ps hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in
            these Terms of Service, provided that:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content
                without K2PS's prior written authorization, unless K2PS makes available the means
                for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the
                Embeddable Player). </li>
            <li>You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service. </li>
            <li>You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video
                playback pages of the Service itself, the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly
                authorized means K2PS may designate. </li>
            <li>You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless
                you obtain YouTube's prior written approval: the sale of access to the Service;
                the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service
                or Content; or the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page
                of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content delivered via the Service, unless
                other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of sufficient
                value to be the basis for such sales. </li>
            <li>Prohibited commercial uses do not include: uploading an original video to K2PS to
                promote your business or artistic enterprise; showing K2PS videos through the Embeddable
                Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising restrictions
                set forth above in Section.D; or any use that K2PS expressly authorizes in writing.
                You are not discourage from putting the occasional K2PS video in your blog to comment
                on it or show your readers a video that you like, even if you have general-purpose
                ads somewhere on your blog. We will, however, enforce our Terms of Use against,
                say, a website that does nothing more than aggregate a bunch of embedded K2PS videos
                and intentionally tries to generate ad revenue from them. </li>
            <li>If you use the Embeddable Player on your website, you may not modify, build upon,
                or block any portion or functionality of the Embeddable Player, including but not
                limited to links back to the K2PS website. </li>
            <li>If you use the K2PS Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install
                updates from time to time from K2PS. These updates are designed to improve, enhance
                and further develop the Uploader and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions,
                new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates
                (and permit K2PS to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Uploader.
            </li>
            <li>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation,
                "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner
                that sends more request messages to the K2PS servers in a given period of time than
                a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line
                web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, K2PS grants the operators of public
                search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the
                sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available
                searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.
                K2PS reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific
                cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information,
                including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems
                provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation
                purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service
                with respect to their Content. </li>
            <li>In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws. </li>
            <li>K2PS reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.
            </li>
            <li>You acknowledge and agree that K2PS.com does not endorse the content of any Member
                and is not responsible or liable for any content, even though it could be unlawful,
                harassing, libelous, privacy invading, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene,

                property or other rights of another. You acknowledge that K2PS.com does not pre-screen

                that is publicly available via the service. </li>
            <li>You acknowledge and agree that you will not submit any content to our Links component
                on any Sport Home Page that could be unlawful, harassing, libelous, privacy invading,

            third party providers, to and from and against all losses, expenses, damages and
            costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any violation of these
            Terms of Use by you. K2PS reserves the right to assume, at its sole expense, the
            exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in
            which event you will fully cooperate with K2PS in asserting any available defenses.

        <p>
            Software available in connection with the K2PS Services is further subject to United
            States export controls. No software may be downloaded from the K2PS Services or

            does not apply, however, to data stored by users under the age of 13 in the event
            that a parent, guardian or caregiver of that child is requesting retrieval and/or
            deletion of that information.

        <h6>
            T. CHOICE OF LAW AND LOCATION FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES.
        </h6>
        <p>
            You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in New Jersey; and
            (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal
            jurisdiction over K2PS, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than
            New Jersey. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive
            laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
            Any claim or dispute between you and K2PS that arises in whole or in part from the
            Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located
            in Monmouth County, New Jersey. These Terms of Service; and any other legal notices
            published by K2PS on the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between
            you and K2PS concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service
            is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision
            shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service,
            which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these
            Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
            any other term, and K2PS's failure to assert any right or provision under these
            Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. K2PS
            reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice,
            and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes.
            Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify
            your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. You further agree and expressly
            consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of New Jersey in
            connection with any such dispute including any claim involving K2PS or its affiliates,
            subsidiaries, employees, contractors, officers, directors, telecommunication providers
            and content providers.
        </p>
        <p>
            YOU AND K2PS AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES
            MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE,
            SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

            U. OTHER TERMS.
        </h6>
        <p>
            If any part of these Terms of Use are determined to be invalid or unenforceable
            pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers
            and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision
            will be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches
            the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue
            in effect. A printed version of these Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic
            form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
            relating to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions
            as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
            form. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

            V. MISCELLANEOUS.
        </h6>
        <p>
            K2PS may assign this contract, in whole or in part, at any time with or without
            notice to you. You may not assign this contract, or any part of it, to any other
            party. Any attempt by you to do so is void. ANY CLAIM RELATED TO THIS CONTRACT OR
            THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICE MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN ONE YEAR. THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINS
            ON THE DATE WHEN THE CLAIM FIRST COULD BE FILED. IF IT IS NOT, THEN THAT CLAIM IS
            PERMANENTLY BARRED. THIS APPLIES TO YOU AND YOUR SUCCESSORS. IT ALSO APPLIES TO
            US AND OUR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The failure of K2PS to exercise or enforce any
            right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right
            or provision. The section titles in the Terms of Use are for convenience only and
            have no legal or contractual effect.
