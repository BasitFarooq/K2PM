    <h6>GLOSSARY</h6>
    <strong>Cause:</strong>
    <p>Something in the private or public interest which can be clearly identified and defined as being important to a large number of people in a community or in society. Causes are often charitable causes and are typically understood to relate to health care or disease control, children’s or other social development issues, environmental or animal protection or other issues thought to be in the best interests of the community.
    </p>

    <strong>Cause marketing (or cause-related marketing):</strong>
    <p>A specific kind or practice of marketing in which for-profit private businesses cooperate with non-profit organizations or charitable causes for mutual benefit. It is sometimes used to refer generally to the marketing of social or other charitable causes. Unlike direct corporate philanthropy or corporate giving, it does not necessarily involve tax-deductible donations (cause marketing is not contingent on the donation of cash). Most students and historians of cause-related marketing attribute its origins in the 1983 American Express campaign designed to raise funds and awareness for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty in New York City.
    </p>

    <h6>Charity or Charitable organization:</h6>
    <p>An organization created for charitable purposes only. All charitable organizations are not-for-profit organizations (although not all not-for-profit organizations are charitable organizations). Charitable organizations can take the form of trusts, foundations, unincorporated associations or specifically-defined companies. In all cases, they are established for a charitable purpose or are clearly defined to acquire that status and purpose after they are established.
    </p>

    <h6>Community Investment:</h6>
    <p>Any form of investment which generates resultant community benefits, amenities or other legacies, ranging from direct donations to marketing to public spin-offs from private ventures.
    </p>

    <h6>Corporate Philanthropy:</h6>
    <p>The process or practice in which private corporations or for-profit businesses donate money, goods, time and/or effort to support a charitable cause or other commonly-accepted worthy community cause or interest. When corporate philanthropy involves the direct donation of cash, it carries a corporate tax benefit (as opposed to other forms of community investment or cause-related marketing which may or may not be undertaken for its tax benefits).
    </p>

    <h6>Donation:</h6>
    <p> gift, typically of money, goods or time, to a charitable organization or specific cause (the donation is made "for charitable purposes").
    </p>

    <h6>Fundraising:</h6>
    <p>Raising money or other value-in-kind by requesting donations from individuals, businesses, organizations, charitable foundations or government agencies. Fundraising typically is understood to refer to those efforts done to gather funds for non-profit organizations and charitable causes (although it is also referred to as the identification and solicitation of investors for private capital placements and ventures).
    </p>

    <h6>Non-Profit Organization (or not-for-profit organization):</h6>
    <p> legally-constituted organization established to promote and develop an activity or series of activities in the private or public interest without commercial or monetary for-profit purposes. Most non-profits (also known as NPOs) operate in the fields of sports, health care, education, arts, culture, environmental protection, human rights and animal protection. NPOs also often exist in order to promote awareness for and raise funds for political or religious causes.
    </p>

    <h6>Philanthropy:</h6>
    <p>The act of donating money, goods, time and/or effort to support a charitable cause or other commonly-accepted worthy cause. Philanthropy is typically accepted to involve a clearly-defined objective. It is also commonly understood to apply to giving over an extended period of time. More broadly defined, philanthropy can refer to any humanitarian or altruistic activity which promotes good or improves quality of life. Philanthropy is derived from the Greek words phil and anthropos, which means "loving people" or "human being".
    </p>

    <h6>Pledge Drives:</h6>
    <p>Short-term campaigns (as short as several hours on a single day) designed to raise funds for a specific cause, usually with the support of a radio, television or other broadcast medium to attract listeners, viewers and, ultimately, donors. Pledge drives are often delivered in the form of telethons or radio campaigns, including in some cases to raise funds for that public broadcaster.
    </p>

    <h6>Sports Philanthropy (or sport philanthropy):</h6>
    <p>That emerging sector of corporate philanthropy in which professional sports teams, clubs or leagues donate money, time or other goods in kind to specific causes or in which philanthropy is extended to and invested in amateur sports programs or sports programs for underprivileged children or families.
