            Disability Sports: Disabled sports are sports played by persons with a disability,
            including physical and intellectual disabilities. As many of these based on existing
            sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes
            referred to as adapted sports. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several
            sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no
            equivalent in able-bodied sports. Disability exists in four categories: physical,
            mental, permanent and temporary. Organized sport for athletes with a disability
            is generally divided into three broad disability groups: the deaf, people with physical
            disabilities, and people with intellectual disabilities

            In our support of sport competition, K2PS will donate a portion of its advertising
