                   <h5>Kids Privacy Policy for Kids2ProSports </h5>
<p>Last Updated: November 9, 2011</p>

<p>We at <u>Kids2ProSports</u> are dedicated to protecting the privacy of kids under the age of 13 
and handling any personal information we obtain from children under the age of 13 with care and respect. 
This Kids Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles 
regarding children under the age of 13 who use the Web site located at <a href="http://www.Kids2ProSports.com">http://www.Kids2ProSports.com</a></p>

<p>Building on our general <a href="PrivacyPolicy.aspx">Privacy Policy</a>, we recognize the need to 
provide additional privacy protections when children visit the site. We explain those additional protections here 
in this Kids Privacy Policy (“Kids Policy”). For your convenience, this Kids Policy uses terms that are defined in 
our general Privacy Policy. Where our general Privacy Policy conflicts with this Kids Policy, this Kids Policy shall 
govern. Otherwise, the terms of our general Privacy Policy shall govern. </p>

<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we (a) inform parents and legal guardians about 
how we collect, use and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age, (b) obtain the prior verifiable 
consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the site, (c) do not 
collect more information than is reasonably necessary for a child to participate in a given activity on this site and (d) 
provide parents with the ability to review and delete the information collected about their kids. When we discuss “kids” 
in this Kids Policy, we mean children under 13 years of age. When we use the term “parent” in this Kids Policy, we mean to 
include legal guardians.</p>

<p>What types of personal information do we collect from and about kids?
This Kids Policy uses the terms “personally identifiable information” and “personal information” synonymously. 
When we use either, we mean information that specifically identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's 
first and last name, e-mail address, postal address or phone number and any demographic or other information about a user, 
such as gender or a user's number of children, when such information is directly associated with personally identifiable information. 
</p>

<p>Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about a group or category of products, services 
or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use a service may 
be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data.</p>

<h6>Direct Collection</h6>
<p>We believe that the user experience is safest for kids when they are not able to enter personal information into the Site. 
Kids can surf the site and view sample content, but kids are eligible to maintain only a limited access account, which does not allow any personal 
information to be entered into the Site. With limited access accounts, kids cannot access certain interactive features located on the Site in connection 
with which kids would be able provide personal information, such as chat rooms, instant messaging, e-mail, message boards or forums and other similar 
interactive activities (the “Interactive Activities”). </p>

<p>Parents should be aware that in using the Interactive Activities, kids would be able to provide written statements and descriptions that could disclose 
personal information or images that could reasonably be used to identify them. Parents and kids should also note that any information or other media posted
 to message boards or other Interactive Activities will be accessible by other users of the Interactive Activities that are allowed by the poster to access 
 their profile and could be used to send unsolicited messages to anyone identified in such information or media. Kids should not post any personally identifiable 
 information, including, without limitation, names, phone numbers, or email addresses, in connection with any Interactive Activities. Parents should talk to their 
 kids about not posting personal information in connection with any Interactive Activities on the Site. </p>

 <p>
 Once we know that a user attempting to register for the Service is a kid, we do not allow that kid to enter personal information, except as permitted in accordance 
 with applicable law (for example, we may collect a kid's name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the safety of a child participant on 
 the Site, to protect the security or integrity of the Site, to take precautions against liability, to respond to judicial process or to provide information to law 
 enforcement agencies or for an investigation on matters related to public safety). 
 </p>

 <p>
 However, we may collect a kid's email address to respond to certain specific requests or inquiries (such as answering a child's question, requesting a subscription to 
 an online newsletter or signing up for a contest), provided that in certain circumstances we may be required to notify parents that we have collected such information 
 and give parents the opportunity to request that we make no further use of such information. Additionally, Kids2Pro may provide the “limited access account” kid with 
 the ability to participate in any of the weplay marketing and/or promotional programs in which the data collected is used only for internal purposes (where no 
 information is shared or publicly disclosed). This may require an email sent to parents requesting their affirmative consent. 
 </p>

 <h6>Passive Collection</h6>
 <p>Please see the “Automatically Collected Information” section of our general <a href="PrivacyPolicy.aspx">Privacy Policy</a> to learn about information that is passively collected on 
 our Site through 
 technology such as cookies. </p>

 <h4 class="static">How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we have collected about kids?</h4>

 <p>We use personal information from kids to complete transactions requested by them, to provide customer services, to customize and develop our products or services, to 
 respond to questions, problems or complaints, to request feedback, to send administrative communications, promotional materials (including special offers and promotions) 
 and information about our products and service, and for other specified purposes for which the personal information was provided and any purpose relating thereto. Please 
 see our general Privacy Policy for a more detailed description of the use of personally identifiable information.</p>

 <p>
 We do not share any personal information about kids with any third parties other than (a) third-party service providers and consultants ("Service Providers") who assist 
 us in performing internal functions in connection with the operation of our business, such as fulfilling orders, processing payments or other information, assisting in 
 verifying parental consent and complying with other applicable regulations, performing internal analysis of the Site or administering surveys on our behalf, (b) in 
 connection with mergers and business transfers as set forth in our general Privacy Policy, and (c) disclosures required by law and to help protect the rights, security 
 and safety of the Site, Weplay, our users or others, as set forth in our general Privacy Policy. </p>

 <p>Service Providers have agreed not to use or retain personal information obtained in connection with the Site for any purpose other than to carry out the services 
 for us and to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of all such personal information obtained in connection with the site.</p>

 <p>Parents and kids should note that any information that kids post to message boards or other Interactive Activities will be accessible by other users of the Interactive 
 Activities with whom the kids allows to access their profile and could be used to send the kid, or anyone else identified in the information posted by the kid, unsolicited 
 messages. Kids should not post any personally identifiable information, including, without limitation, names, phone numbers, or email addresses, in connection with any 
 Interactive Activities. Parents should talk to their children about not posting personal information in connection with their participation in Interactive Activities on the Site.</p>

 <p>Parents have the right to consent to our collection and use of personal information from their kids without also consenting to our disclosure of such information to third 
 parties (except for disclosures to third parties who provide support for the internal operations of the Site and who do not use or disclose that information for any other purpose). 
 Parents will be given the opportunity to exercise this right if their kids' actions on the site trigger an email to the parents requesting any parental consent (as discussed above). 
 Note that all sites that are directed to children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a kid's participation in an online activity on the kid's providing more personal 
 information than is reasonably necessary. </p>

 <h6>How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of information from their kids? </h6>
 <p>If a kid attempts to register and indicates that his or her age is under 13, the account will automatically be flagged as a limited access account that restricts access to certain 
 weplay features, and we will ask the kid to provide us with his or her first name and a parent's email address so that we may contact a parent to request consent in the event the 
 kid takes any action on the Site that would require entry of personal information (as discussed above). In the event the kid takes any such action on the Site, we will then send an 
 email to the parent's email address containing our notice to parents of our practices regarding use, collection and disclosure of personal information about kids (the “Notice to Parents”) 
 and requesting verifiable consent to collection of the kid's personal information as outlined in the Notice to Parents. </p>

 <p>We will retain the parent's email address for a reasonable time to allow the parent to consent to collection of the kid's personal information and to provide a means for parents to 
 authenticate themselves if they desire access to the child's account. If the parent does not provide consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the email address and we will not 
 collect any personal information from the kid. </p>

 <h6>How can parents review, change or delete personal information collected from their kids? </h6>

 <p>Parents have the right to review and have deleted from our records personal information collected from their kids. Further, at any time parents may refuse to permit us to collect 
 further personal information from their kids. To change or delete account information that we have collected from their kids, parents must contact us by sending an e-mail to privacy@kids2pro.com.
  Parents should please include the child's username and their own e-mail address in the e-mail so that we can better assist with any such inquiry or request. </p>

<h6>How will we notify parents if our Kids Privacy Policy changes?</h6>

<p>We reserve the right to amend this Kids Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share kids' 
personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses. We will apply material changes in our Kids Privacy 
Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent. </p>

<h6>What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</h6>
<p>The security measures for the Site are described in the “Network and Information Security” section of our general <a href="PrivacyPolicy.aspx">Privacy Policy.</a> </p>
